I am a Doctor in Physics currently switching from academia to industry. I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town in South Africa for three years and had a semester experience as a lecturer at the Federal University of Itajuba in Brazil in 2021. I am currently interested in Machine Learning applications and the overall workflow of data analysis.
