### About me

<img align="right" width="400" src="git3.jpg">


I am a Doctor in Physics currently switching from academia to industry. I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town in South Africa for three years and had a semester experience as a lecturer at the Federal University of Itajuba in Brazil in 2021. I am currently interested in Machine Learning applications and the overall workflow of data analysis. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project to help identify topics in Physics students in Brazil struggle the most.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects on data analysis or Machine learning.
